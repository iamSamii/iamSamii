👋 Hi, I’m @iamSamii
🌱 I’m currently new on this platform and actively learning how to use GitHub efficiently along with its features for version control and collaboration.
💻 Aspiring DevOps Engineer, focusing on Cloud Technologies like AWS, and enhancing my skills in Linux, scripting (Bash, Python), CI/CD pipelines, DevOps tools.
🌐 I’m also working on mastering Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible to automate and scale cloud infrastructure.
🔧 As part of my learning journey, I’m exploring containerization with Docker and Kubernetes for orchestration, alongside monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
📈 Currently focused on building a strong foundation in continuous integration and continuous delivery workflows using GitHub Actions, and other DevOps tools.
👍 I’m eager to collaborate and contribute to open-source projects, and I’m always open to learning from the community.
🚀 My goal is to create a portfolio showcasing real-world projects, certifications, and contributions to public repositories to strengthen my technical profile.
🙂 Please guide me through this journey, and I look forward to working with you all in the near future!
Thank you!!
